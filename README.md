*Load time may take a bit longer sometimes as Heroku puts the app to sleep if it has been idle for a while*

## Overview & Technical Features:
Users can log information about topics they're learning about and make detailed entries as they learn about each topic.

      - Utilized Python's Django web-framework to handle/route data between webpages and the backend/database
      - Implemented user login/registration and authentication using Django's built-ins for forms and security
      - Used SQLite to hold information about data models (Topics, Entries, Users, primary/foreign keys)
      - Each user's data (topics & entries) is saved between logins
      - Used HTML/Bootstrap to make responsive webpages
      - Administrator privileges are held by me
      - Created within a virtual environment 
      - Deployed to Heroku
