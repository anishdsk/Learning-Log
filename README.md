# Learning-Log

## URL:

### My Heroku account is experiencing problems at the moment. I contacted Heroku to fix it so the URL may be down for a few days. I have uploaded pictures of the app's pages and features at the bottom of the README that you can look at it in the meantime.

*Load times may take a bit longer sometimes as Heroku puts the web-app to sleep if it has been idle for a while*

## Overview & Technical Features:
Users can log information about topics they are learning about and make detailed entries as they learn about each topic.

      - Utilized Python's Django web-framework to handle/route data between webpages and the backend/database
      - Implemented user login/authentication and security also using Django
      - Used SQLite to hold information about data models (Topics, Entries, Users, primary/foreign keys)
      - Data for each user is preserved between logins unless the user deletes it themselves
      - Used HTML and Bootstrap to make responsive webpages
      - Admin privileges are held by me
      - Created within a virtual environment 
      - Deployed to Heroku
